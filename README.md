# Interactive dashboards/apps
Exploring interactive machine learning model dashboards/apps that can be used to better understand and analyze the important factors in which the model works, or for visualisations.

## 1. Visualising the MNIST dataset using TensorBoard
Getting a machine to recognise handwritten single digits is difficult. The aim here is to analyse the features of handwritten digits, using a CNN model, visualised in TensorBoard.


## 2. Interactive web application 
Clinicians need a way to assess the likelihood of a patient being readmitted due to diabetes. So the aim is to create an API framework using Flask/python, that accepts the inputs into a Logistic Regression model, and return the re-admission probability of patients with diabetes.
